**Set character bruteforce limit**

**Set password-list**

Here you can change the password list you want to use to check the password against. To add/delete a passwordlist you need to add/delete .txt files in the folder "password_lists" which should be in the same folder as "main.py". The password lists should have words seperated by a new line.
